# MBINGULA_FRONTEND - ReactJS
 My final university project - Mbingula Restaurant

# Frontend of the software for the restaurant - MBINGULA

This is a project I started around "03/17/2024", where I was given a challenge to provide solutions to the problems faced by Restaurante Mbingula (Luanda, Angola) up until "09/15/2024".

<strong>Online management system developed</strong> for <strong>Mbingula Restaurant</strong>, located in Talatona, Luanda ‚Äì approximately 400 meters past the FreshMart supermarket. The goal of the project was to modernize the restaurant‚Äôs internal processes and provide a better experience for customers. The application has two main areas: one for administrators (management of orders, products, employees, and reports) and another for customers (placing orders, viewing the menu, and table reservations). The project was developed by a team of three people, with my main responsibility being the interface design and the development of user interaction with the system (UI/UX and Fullstack).

* Collected and analyzed data from the restaurant to understand the business needs;
* Designed the application layout in Figma, prioritizing usability and aesthetics;
* Implemented the design in React, ensuring visual fidelity and responsiveness;
* Integrated the frontend with the backend-developed API;
* Collaborated on backend adjustments to align features with the system logic.
